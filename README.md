Rule-Based Chatbot System with Basic NLP

This Python script implements a simple rule-based chatbot system capable of responding to user queries using predefined rules and patterns. The chatbot focuses on common customer inquiries and provides accurate and relevant answers to enhance user interaction. It utilizes basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse user input and extract relevant information.

Key Components:

Predefined Rules and Responses: The chatbot defines a set of predefined rules and associated responses for common customer inquiries such as greetings, opening hours, product information, etc. Each rule consists of a regular expression pattern and a list of possible responses.

Extract Intent Function: The extract_intent function extracts the intent from the user input based on the predefined rules. It matches the user input against the patterns defined in the rules to identify the intent of the query.

Respond to Query Function: The respond_to_query function processes the user input, extracts the intent using extract_intent, and retrieves a response from the predefined responses associated with that intent. If no intent is extracted, it provides a default response.

User Interaction Loop: The script starts a conversation loop where the chatbot greets the user, accepts user input, processes it using respond_to_query, and prints the response. The loop continues until the user decides to exit the conversation.

Usage:

Run the script, and the chatbot will greet the user and wait for input.
Enter a query or question, and the chatbot will respond with an appropriate answer based on the predefined rules.
The conversation continues until the user types "exit" to end the chat.
Enhancements:

The chatbot's functionality can be expanded by adding more predefined rules and responses to cover a wider range of inquiries.
Advanced NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, or machine learning models can be integrated to improve understanding and response generation.
